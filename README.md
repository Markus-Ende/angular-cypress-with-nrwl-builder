# Example Angular CLI project setup with builder for Cypress e2e tests

Uses the [Cypress builder that comes with @nrwl/builders](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/blob/master/packages/builders/src/cypress/cypress.builder.ts) to compile Cypress e2e tests (and setup code) written in TypeScript and run them.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) with GUI.

Run `ng e2e --headless=true` to execute the end-to-end tests in headless mode.
